An over-tight budget fails OPEN only while some stream resolves inside it: `find_stream_info` then returns success with a logged warning, and the session loads with late-resolving tracks silently missing. When NO stream resolves inside the budget it returns an error (`-1`, rendered "Operation not permitted") and the load throws. `[Demuxer] open timings` prints the connect / open_input / find_stream_info split of every open, which is the measurement to take before and after tightening it (AE#678). The value is written to the context verbatim (FFmpeg's AVOption floor of 32 is bypassed), so validate track presence after load if you set this aggressively. The routing `probe(url:)` API and still extraction keep the full budget; the embedded subtitle side-demuxer caps its own probe (it only needs codec ids, not resolved sparse tracks) and tightens to this value when it is smaller (#76). Default nil (#68).
