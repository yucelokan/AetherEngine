/// #377: one request budget per origin, shared by every path the reader fetches on.
///
/// `httpMaximumConnectionsPerHost` is a per-`URLSession` cap, and `AVIOReader` fetches over four
/// pools: `persistentSession` (2) for the pump's ranges, `chunkSession` (2) for detour blocks,
/// `probeSession` on `URLSessionConfiguration.default` (6) for size probes and HEAD, plus a
/// per-call streaming session. Those caps do not compose. Against one signed CDN URL a pump range,
/// a detour block and a probe can all be open at once, and a second reader (the subtitle side
/// demuxer) shares the same static pools, so the ceiling is a sum nobody wrote down.
///
/// The cap also measures the wrong thing. `httpMaximumConnectionsPerHost` bounds TCP connections,
/// and over HTTP/2 URLSession multiplexes every request of a session onto one of them, so a cap of
/// 1 there bounds nothing at all while the origin still counts the requests. This budget counts
/// requests, which is what an origin metering us counts, and is therefore equally true on h2 and
/// http/1.1. `ReaderTransportLog` records which one is actually in use.
///
/// Counting is unconditional; capping is not. With no limit set, `acquire` hands out a ticket
/// immediately and only tallies, so a healthy origin sees exactly the behaviour it saw before this
/// existed. A limit arrives one of two ways: the host names it (`LoadOptions.maxConcurrentSourceRequests`),
/// or the origin does, by answering 429/503/509, after which the budget halves from the concurrency
/// it had actually reached. There is no automatic increase: an origin that has metered us once is
/// treated as metering for the rest of the process, which costs some parallelism and no correctness.
/// A refusal also arms a request-rate pacer for that origin. It is deliberately learned rather than
/// host-configured: the measured CDN served eight parallel 32 MB reads but first refused a run of
/// 256 KB reads after 36 requests in 10 seconds, so concurrency and request rate are separate limits.
/// Sixty seconds without another refusal disarms pacing; the learned concurrency ceiling remains
/// because its recovery policy belongs to the existing budget.
///
/// A redirect chain is ONE origin here (#388). A metered source is routinely a portal that 302s to
/// the host serving the bytes, and the host loading it can only name the portal: keeping a separate
/// bucket per hop meant the declared ceiling stopped at the proxy, the pump's slot was booked
/// against an origin it had stopped fetching from, and a detour block opened as a second request
/// against a host whose books showed nothing in flight. `noteRedirect` folds them.
///
/// Deadlock is excluded structurally rather than managed. A reader that already holds a ticket must
/// never block on a second one, so at `limit == 1` the speculative parallel paths (detour blocks,
/// the tail prefetch, the staggered probe fan) are switched off instead of queued, and each of them
/// already has a serial fallback: the detour's is repositioning the persistent connection, the
/// probe fan's is running its probes in order. What remains queueing on the semaphore are requests
/// that no reader holds a ticket across.
