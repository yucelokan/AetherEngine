/// #177 issue 1: the ingest segment loop awaited each fetch fully before starting the next,
/// so every segment paid a connection + TTFB round-trip with no bytes flowing and the
/// producer could not get ahead of the playhead on high-bitrate live streams. The loop now
/// runs a bounded prefetch pipeline: up to `maxConcurrentSegmentFetches` fetches in flight,
/// committed to the FIFO strictly in playlist order.
///
/// The loopback origin adds per-segment latency and records how many segment requests are
/// being served concurrently. Serial fetch never exceeds 1; the pipeline must overlap
/// (>= 2) while staying inside its window (<= 4). Byte order in the FIFO stays playlist
/// order even when a slow segment completes after its successors.
