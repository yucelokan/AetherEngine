/// Reported shape: four live tiles against one Jellyfin origin, each its own engine. Tiles 1 and 2
/// tune, tiles 3 and 4 receive zero bytes and give up 15 s later, on sim and on device. Three
/// concurrent `curl` pulls of the same endpoints flow at full rate, so the origin is not the wall.
///
/// The wall was `httpMaximumConnectionsPerHost = 2` on `persistentSession`, a `static let`, so those
/// two connections were the whole process's allowance to one origin. On the bounded pool that number
/// throttles, because every request on it ends. On the open-ended pool nothing ahead of the third
/// request is going to end, so it is not slowed, it is parked, and URLSession parks it with no
/// callback, no error and no metrics: `awaitFirstPersistentData` then spends its full 15 s and the
/// load reports a source that would not open.
