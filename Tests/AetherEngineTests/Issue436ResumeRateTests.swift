/// AE#436: `AVPlayer.play()` is rate 1.0 by definition, so a resume used to drop the speed the host
/// had set, and a client could not hold it from outside: the engine re-issues play() from the
/// readyToPlay re-assert after an item swap, from interruption and background resume, from the #287
/// premature-end recovery, and AVKit and the remote command centre call it straight on the player.
/// The rate a resume comes back at is `AVPlayer.defaultRate` (the platform's own answer, "the rate at
/// which to start playback when play is called"), so recording it there covers every one of those
/// paths without anyone writing rate inside a resume window. The software hosts already resumed at
/// their remembered rate; what they lacked was a way for the engine to seed it across a rebuild.
