/// PR #512 follow-up: the software VOD read-ahead must stop at its forward window on material
/// whose presentation coverage cannot be described.
///
/// The forward-second limit used to be keyed on the coverage frontier alone, which reports nothing
/// once a single late presentation timestamp invalidates the H.264 successor model, and freezes at
/// a hole in the packet-duration model. Either one removed the seconds limit entirely and left the
/// disk budget as the only bound, which in a session is the difference between a window and the
/// whole file. The limit is measured on the reservoir instead: the newest stored video timestamp
/// against the one the consumer last took.
