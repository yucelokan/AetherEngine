        // Pinned to the minor rather than `from:`: this package ships the
        // prebuilt decode stack, so a floating minor silently changes which
        // FFmpeg a released engine tag runs (2.3.0 -> 2.4.0 did exactly that
        // under 5.28.0), and a minor that raises a platform floor retroactively
        // breaks every tag that floats onto it (LibDovi 1.1.0, below). Patch
        // rebuilds still reach existing tags, which is where a pure rebuild
        // belongs; anything that adds slices or enables a component is a minor
        // and reaches consumers through an engine release.
        .package(url: "https://github.com/superuser404notfound/FFmpegBuild", .upToNextMinor(from: "3.7.0")),  // 3.7.0: the mp4 muxer's dec3 box describes a DD+ track whose height channels and Atmos objects live in a dependent substream (Blu-ray style AC-3 core plus E-AC-3 dependent frame): chan_loc is derived from chanmap per TS 102 366 (upstream f10fdd6310, backported) and the TS 103 420 JOC extension is taken from the dependent substream too, so such a track is no longer described as a bare 5.1 bed and an Atmos receiver no longer reports multichannel PCM (#728); same n8.1.3 otherwise; 3.6.0: an MPEG-TS audio PID is identified by its payload when its label does not name the codec: the raw dts / truehd / loas demuxers are in, so the mpegts content probe can confirm DTS, TrueHD and LATM at all (without them the lenient mp3 probe named the track, whatever the label), and a PID labelled 0x03 (MPEG-1 audio) gets the same content probe as 0x04; a DTS-HD IPTV channel opened as mp3 and never produced a frame (#641); same n8.1.3 otherwise; 3.5.0: FFmpeg n8.1.3, 268 upstream commits over n8.1.2, of which six touch code this engine ships: VP9 kept `next_refs[]` referenced across `avcodec_flush_buffers()`, so a worker could reseed its references from the pre-flush set and the first inter frame after a seek decoded against released buffers (heap OOB read and write, and this engine decodes VP9 with frame threading and flushes on every reposition); the Dolby Vision RPU parser trims trailing zero padding again, which n8.1.2 had stopped doing, so a padded RPU no longer fails the ext-block size check and loses its dynamic metadata, and the RPU partition counts are bounded; a VC-1 picture ending on a one-bit skipped macroblock keeps that macroblock instead of falling into error concealment; the `dca_core` bsf clears the profile it has just stripped; and a container channel layout survives a failed decoder open during probing. Same dav1d 1.5.4, zimg 3.0.6 and libzvbi 0.2.45 (all current upstream), same component set, same six local patches, unchanged soname majors; 3.4.0: FFmpeg learns the `dav1` sample entry in both directions, the AV1 variant of `av01` that signals Dolby Vision, so a Profile 10.0 source can be read at all and can be remuxed with the tag its packaging requires; stock FFmpeg has it in neither of its two mp4 tag tables, so the read probes as "unknown codec" and the write fails EINVAL (#547); same n8.1.2 binaries as 3.3.0 otherwise, compiled against the Xcode 27 SDKs with unchanged deployment targets; 3.3.0: every slice a shipped app can embed carries its dSYM inside the xcframework, so Xcode copies it into `.xcarchive/dSYMs` and a crash inside FFmpeg symbolicates instead of staying a list of addresses (FFmpegBuild#4); same n8.1.2 binaries as 3.2.1 apart from their UUID, the libraries just compile with `-gline-tables-only` now and the debug map is harvested before the shipped binary is stripped; 3.2.1: vc1_parser seeds its parse context from extradata, so a seek landing on an entry point alone keeps its picture size instead of falling back to 0x0 or to a size read out of the following payload (#490, FFmpeg PR 24458); 3.2.0: the legacy Flash tail, video and audio together (flv1 / vp6 / vp6f / vp6a, nellymoser, adpcm_swf, speex, and FLV's pcm_s16be / pcm_u8 / pcm_alaw / pcm_mulaw), so a pre-2008 .flv plays with sound where before only H.264-in-FLV did; flashsv stays out, it needs zlib and would have been dropped silently; 3.1.0: native .wmv / .asf, the asf demuxer plus every WMA decoder (Standard, Pro, Lossless, Voice), which is the container half of the legacy Microsoft support 2.4.3 started (FFmpegBuild#3); 3.0.0: every target, product, framework bundle and install name carries an `Aether` prefix, so this build can sit in an app that already has an FFmpeg (FFmpegKit, MobileVLCKit, mpv); same n8.1.2 binaries as 2.5.0, only names changed; 2.5.0: libzvbi 0.2.45 for GHSA-86rm-g7qf-j2fh (OOB read/write + integer underflow, reachable through the libzvbi_teletext decoder), dav1d 1.5.4, zimg 3.0.6, and the concat demuxer removed (a script demuxer selectable by probing alone, which made any stream a potential file-open primitive); 2.4.3: the legacy Microsoft video decoders (msmpeg4v1/v2/v3, wmv1/wmv2/wmv3; FFmpegBuild#3); 2.4.2: pgssubdec missing-palette recovery, replaces the 2.1.1 Epoch-Continue retain (#142); 2.4.1: qtrle decoder; 2.4.0: visionOS (xros) device + simulator slices; 2.3.0: webvtt demuxer (standalone .vtt sidecars, plus the cue settings as packet side data); 2.2.0: matroska TTS warn-only per RFC 9559 (#145 rework); 2.1.3: sup demuxer (raw PGS sidecars); 2.1.2: matroska TrackTimestampScale clamp (#145, dropped in 2.2.0); 2.1.1: pgssubdec Epoch-Continue retain (#142); 2.1.0: yadif_videotoolbox + hwupload (Metal GPU deinterlace); 2.0.0: dynamic frameworks (LGPL), zvbi GPL excision
