/// chunk boundary; ~1.9 s of content vanished at every 32 MB range rotation, heard as a
/// once-a-minute audio desync). Headers cannot expose the lie, so the caller declares it and the
/// reader must run ONE unranged GET from byte 0 - no bounded-range windowing, no suffix/tail
/// probe, no size probe, no detour fills - and must report a lost connection as EIO, never EOF
