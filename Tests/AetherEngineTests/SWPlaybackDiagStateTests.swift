/// AE#479: the `[SWDiag]` audio marker after a seek.

/// `lastAudioPts` is the newest audio the pump enqueued, written by the pump alone. A seek flushes the
/// audio queue on the main actor while the pump is still on the pre-seek generation: after a playing
/// seek the pump writes its stale local once more before it notices the generation, and a seek that
/// lands paused parks the pump in its pause wait, where it writes nothing until `play()`. Either way
/// the line printed the old PTS against the re-anchored clock (`aLead=475.49` on a backward scrub in
/// the field, `-23.89` on a forward one on the harness), for one tick or for the whole paused stretch.
