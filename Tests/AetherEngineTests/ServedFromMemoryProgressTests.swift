/// #380 follow-up. The report named ONE branch: the window serve, where draining read-ahead reset
/// the reconnect ladders and so held a refusing origin at streak=1 for as long as the runway
/// lasted. The read loop serves from memory in three places, and the other two were charging the
/// ladders the same way:
///
/// - the retained head/tail spans (#281), which run FIRST, before every network path, and whose
///   own log line says "no reconnect for it";
/// - the detour cache's resident-block hit (#69), the parse ping-pong's cheap path.
///
/// The span serve is the one that reaches a metered origin: a rate-limit status hands the origin
/// to the #377 budget, which caps it to one request and takes the detour out of service
/// (`originRequiresSerialRequests`), while the spans keep serving. That is the field shape #380
/// described as "one served byte reset the whole ladder and it started over".
