// #378: a refused source. The reported origin (an Xtream panel behind a portal's 302) answered every GET —
// the suffix tail prefetch, the ranged data connection at byte 0, the size probes and the unranged
// streaming GET — with 403 for about twenty seconds, while a HEAD came back 200 with no length.
//
// What the host got out of that was `sourceOpenFailed` with FFmpeg's "Invalid data found when
// processing input": the streaming delegate allowed any status, so the 403 error page went into the
// stream buffer and FFmpeg probed it as container bytes. The 403 the data connection had already
// been refused with was recorded as an Int and then read as "no size resolved". Nothing in the
// classification could tell a refused origin from a corrupt file. And because the tail prefetch's
// delegate took any non-206 as "no suffix range support", one 403 also switched the prefetch off
// for that origin for the rest of the process.
//
// Three fixes, each measured against a scripted origin: the streaming GET hangs up on anything but
// a 200/206 and the open fails typed with the status; after a 401/403/404/410 at byte 0 the HEAD and
// `bytes=0-1` probes are not issued (the one request still made is the unranged GET, so an origin
// that refuses `Range` but serves a plain GET plays forward-only); and only the origin's answer to
// the range FORM (a 200, a 416) latches the suffix-range denial.
