/// One statement about a seek's lifecycle: its outcome and the target it belonged to, in a single value
/// (AetherEngine#38 follow-up).
///
/// `isSeeking` / `seekTarget` are a LEVEL signal, and a level cannot say why it fell. "Landed on the
/// target", "spent the recovery budget with the clock parked at the target while the source keeps
/// stalling", and "a newer seek took over" all read as the same falling edge. Worse, the two properties
/// clear in the same recompute with no ordering guarantee across a queue hop, so the target that the
/// edge belonged to can already be gone when a consumer reads it. The synchronized-playback host that
/// asked for the signal rebuilt all of that host-side out of a landing grace, a retained last target and
/// a 180 s unreached-target map; this stream is what those heuristics were approximating.
///
/// Contract:
///
/// - Every `.began` is terminated by exactly one `.landed`, `.stalled` or `.superseded` under the same
///   `id`, with one deliberate exception: a `.stalled` seek stays alive inside AVPlayer as recovery
///   intent, so a `.landed` for the same `id` can still arrive, minutes later on a stalled source. That
///   late landing is the edge a level signal structurally cannot carry, because the level fell at the
///   give-up.
/// - `.rejected` stands alone. The seek never reached a host, so it has no `.began` and no terminator.
/// - `target` is on the same axis as `clock.currentTime` (source PTS, display origin folded out).
/// - `.landed` carries the position actually rendered, which keyframe granularity and a playing item's
///   overshoot can put a few seconds off `target`.
///
/// Events are published on the main actor, in emission order.
