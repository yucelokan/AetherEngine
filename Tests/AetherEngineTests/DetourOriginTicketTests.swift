/// Audit DMX-105: a detour block took an origin ticket in `detourFetchBlock` and a second one inside

/// took the last slot and the inner acquire waited its whole four second budget for it: +4 s per
/// block, and a third request on the books against a limit of two. A reader that already holds a
/// ticket must never block on another, so the detour holds one.
