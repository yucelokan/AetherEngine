/// #309: a transport that dies silently while the window can still serve reads.
///
/// Two separate defects, and only the first one is in the report:
/// - Detection. `connStallTimeout` was evaluated in exactly one place, inside the read loop's
///   forward wait, so nothing noticed a dead flow while reads were satisfied from the window.
///   The persistent request also sets `timeoutInterval = 0`, so the transport is not expected to
///   notice either: the reader is the only detector there is, and it only ticked when a consumer
///   happened to block.
/// - Recovery. The frontier refill fired only for PLANNED ends (a delivered range, a high-water
///   end). An error-ended generation was replaced only once the window had drained to EMPTY, so
///   the reader spent 16 MB of read-ahead before asking for a replacement, and playback rejoined
///   the clock with a burst (the field report's +17 MB interval and 389 dropped frames). Detecting
///   the death instantly would not have changed that by itself.
///
/// The origin serves a range, stops writing mid-body, and keeps the socket open with no FIN, which
/// is the reader-observable shape of the field case (URLSession surfaced nothing until the task was
/// later cancelled).
///
/// `.serialized`: one case mutates the process-wide backoff-scale hook, and keeping the four off each
/// other's timing is worth more than running them concurrently. The stall threshold and the consumer
/// pace are deliberately NOT process-wide hooks: swift-testing runs suites in parallel, and a hook
/// that every reader reads at init would reach into whatever suite happens to run alongside this one.
