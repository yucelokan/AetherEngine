///
/// HEVC kept the strict `pts + duration` model, and a Matroska file muxed with 41 ms durations
/// against 41/42 ms deltas opens a one-tick hole at every 42 ms step: 0.70 islands a frame,
/// `bufferedPosition` stuck at the end of the current island. And a coverage that reached its range
/// cap stopped describing new packets (plain) or invalidated itself (successor model) instead of
/// forgetting the history behind the playhead.
