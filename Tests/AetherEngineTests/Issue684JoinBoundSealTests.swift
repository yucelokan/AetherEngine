// Tests/AetherEngineTests/Issue684JoinBoundSealTests.swift
// AE#684: the seal over the upstream segment, as far as the join can pay for it.
//
// The join is three upstream segments on anything longer than about 5 s and is not deepened for the
// seal. Three 6 s segments are 18 s joined; the last GOP stays open until the next upstream delivery,
// so 16 s are cut, and the 18 s holdback of a TARGETDURATION 6 is not reachable from the join at all.
// Waiting for it is waiting for the next upstream segment: measured 4.25 s to first picture where
// 7.25.1 took 0.18 s. A join that has handed over everything it will seals the largest value its cut
// content covers, between what the seal was without the upstream term and the full one.
//
// "Has handed over everything" is a fact the reader states. Round 1 derived it from EXTINF sums with
// a tolerance, and a playlist whose EXTINF over-reports its media (6.3 for 6 s, measured in review)
// never added up: TD 7, a 21 s holdback, bounded start after the grace, 2.23 s to first picture.
