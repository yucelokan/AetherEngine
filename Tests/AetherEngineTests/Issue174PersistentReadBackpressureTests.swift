/// Backpressure history (#174 → #220 → #310) — each design fixed the previous one's failure
/// mode, and these tests pin the current one:
/// - #174: delegate-blocking had no flow-control contract (TLS/H2 transports keep reading at
///   line rate into unbounded URLSession-internal allocations until jetsam) and was replaced
///   with task suspend/resume.
/// - #220: suspend() measured advisory — 911 MB arrived after a suspend — so requests became
///   bounded ranges and a hard cap ended a connection the suspend failed to park.
/// - #310: a task that DID park held a dormant established flow whose closed receive window
///   starves every Network.framework flow in the process on user-space-networking OSes
///   (tvOS/iOS). The suspend is gone: at winHighWater the connection is ENDED and the read
///   loop re-requests at the frontier once the consumer drains below winLowWater. A stalled
///   or paused consumer therefore holds NO connection at all — which is what these tests pin.
///
/// They run a loopback HTTP/1.1 origin that counts every body byte it manages to write and
/// records every Range it is asked for.
