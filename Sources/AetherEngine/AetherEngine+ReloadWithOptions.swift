/// AE#460: a session-preserving reload that changes a `LoadOption`.
///
/// Every in-place rebuild a host could ask for was tied to a selection (an audio-track switch, a
/// subtitle-track switch, a disc-title switch) or replayed the session's own options verbatim
/// (`reloadAtCurrentPosition()`). An option a host needed to CORRECT mid-session could therefore
/// only be changed by a fresh `load()`, and a fresh load is not the same rebuild: `load` cannot
/// reach `subtitleSessionCarryover` or `isLiveRejoin`, both settable only from inside the engine,
/// so the id-exact external-subtitle registry, mid-session `addExternalSubtitleTrack`
/// registrations, the host's explicit subtitle authority (subtitles explicitly OFF included) and
/// the live rejoin contract are all wiped and re-derived by auto-selection. The correction bought
/// the viewer a visible restart and lost session state on the way.
///
/// This is that same reload with the options it replays taken from the host. Three rules make it
/// safe to hand a host the whole struct:
///
/// 1. **A field that NAMES the session is not correctable.** `isLive`, `audioOnly`,
///    `nativeRemoteHLS` and `sequentialOrigin` decide which pipeline the source is opened on, and
///    the engine writes the last two itself (the #154 / #168 remote-HLS reroute, the probe's
///    no-video fallback). Changing one is a different item, not a correction of this one.
/// 2. **A refusal costs nothing.** Both the identity check and the reloadability check run before
///    any teardown, so a refused correction leaves the session exactly as it was, playing.
/// 3. **The engine states what it took.** A reload that silently applied three quarters of a
///    correction would be worse than one that refused it, so the changed fields are named in the
///    log, the refused ones in the thrown error, and all of them in the returned
///    `SessionOptionCorrectionOutcome`. The third answer, a field the session owns, is neither
///    refused nor applied, so for a while it existed only in the log; a host had to parse a
///    diagnostic to learn what its own call had done (AE#464 round 4).

    /// ```swift
    /// try await engine.reloadAtCurrentPosition { $0.httpHeaders["Authorization"] = "Bearer \(fresh)" }

    /// rebuild, so the internal reopens that follow (audio switch, background reload) replay the
    /// correction rather than reverting to the load-time value.
    ///
    /// Unlike `reloadAtCurrentPosition()`, which returns silently when there is nothing to rebuild,
    /// this one throws `AetherEngineError.sessionNotReloadable`: a host correcting a session needs
    /// to tell "corrected" from "did nothing" to decide whether to fall through to a fresh load.

    /// A correction whose every changed field is the session's own (`autoplay`) is answered without
    /// a rebuild: there is nothing for one to carry, and the teardown it used to spend was a visible
