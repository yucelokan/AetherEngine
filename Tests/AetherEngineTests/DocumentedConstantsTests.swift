/// The documentation quotes numbers. "32 entries", "six hours", "a quarter of the tmp volume's free
/// space, capped at 2 GiB", "the historical default of 10". Every one of those is a constant living
/// somewhere in `Sources/`, copied into prose by hand, and nothing has ever held the two together:
/// change the constant and the docs keep asserting the old value in a sentence that still reads
/// perfectly. That is the same failure the API-coverage tests exist for, one level down. A wrong
/// number is worse than a missing one, because a reader budgets against it.
///
/// So each check below pins a documented number to the code that owns it, and names the sentence to
/// fix when it moves. The check is deliberately NOT "the constant is right": that is a product
/// decision and belongs in the test that covers the behaviour. It is "the docs and the code still
/// say the same thing", and the fix for a failure here is usually one word in one Markdown file.
