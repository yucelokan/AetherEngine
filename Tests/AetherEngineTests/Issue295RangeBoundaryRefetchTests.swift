/// #295: a linear read that crosses a bounded-range boundary must not re-fetch what the origin
/// already delivered. The #220 frontier refill exists so the boundary is not a stall: it opens the
/// next range while bytes are still resident ahead of the read position. `startPersistentConnection`
/// then resets `winStart` to that frontier and drops the window, so the very next read sits BELOW
/// the new window start, takes the backward branch, and pulls the bytes it just discarded back over
/// the network one 4 MB detour block at a time, on the demux read thread.
///
/// The shape only appears when the consumer is SLOWER than the transfer, which is playback: the
/// range completes long before the window drains, so the refill fires with up to `winLowWater`
/// bytes still resident ahead of the read position. A test that reads flat out drains the window
/// as fast as it arrives, reaches the boundary with nothing undrained, and sees nothing.
