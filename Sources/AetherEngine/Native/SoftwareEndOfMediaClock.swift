/// `AVSampleBufferRenderSynchronizer` is the master clock for the whole software session, and nothing
/// used to stop it at end of media: the demux loop drained, published `.ended` and parked its own
/// threads, but left the synchronizer at rate 1. So `currentTime` kept walking past `duration` for as
/// long as the host held the session, and the 1 Hz `[SWDiag]` line kept reporting an `aLead` falling at
/// exactly 1.00 per second, which is the shape of a session drifting rather than of one that finished.
/// A downstream host read those lines as evidence of a clock defect, and so did this repo. The native
/// path parks on its final sample; this is what makes the two agree.
