/// Two separate defects hid behind one symptom. The byte counter the sampler derives every
/// byte-shaped figure from was read through `nativeVideoSession`, which a software session does not
/// have, so bitrate, throughput and transferred bytes were a hard zero for the whole session rather
/// than the real numbers. And the read-ahead the path does hold was computed for the memprobe only,
/// so nothing on the public surface answered "is the network keeping up" where it matters most.
