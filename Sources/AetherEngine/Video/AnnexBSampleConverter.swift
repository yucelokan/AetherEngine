/// movenc does this conversion itself whenever the extradata is Annex B, but for an `hvc1` sample
/// entry it runs `ff_hevc_annexb2mp4` with `filter_ps` set and drops every in-band VPS, SPS and PPS.
/// The decoder is then left with the parameter sets in `hvcC` alone. A Blu-ray or broadcast HEVC
/// stream that sends a new PPS mid-title (seen at 118 s and 345.7 s on one UHD disc) has every later
/// slice decoded against the stale one: macOS reports "Cannot Decode", a device plays sound over a
/// black picture. Converting here, and handing movenc a length-prefixed record so it does not convert
/// again, keeps the parameter sets in the samples. That is the shape a Matroska remux of the same
/// stream already reaches the muxer in (its samples carry their in-band parameter sets and movenc
/// copies them as they are).
