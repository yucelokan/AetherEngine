# Architecture

How AetherEngine is put together: the three playback pipelines, the source-file map, and the dependency surface. For the public API and integration, see the [README](../README.md); for format and codec depth, [docs/formats.md](formats.md).

## Playback pipelines

AetherEngine has three playback pipelines, picked once at `load(url:)`: the audio-only path when `LoadOptions.audioOnly` is set, otherwise the native or software video path based on the source's video codec.

### Native AVPlayer pipeline (default)

Demux the source with libavformat, re-mux the elementary streams on the fly into HLS-fMP4, serve them from a local HTTP server on an ephemeral port (the player is handed `127.0.0.1:<port>/<session-token>/...`; the listener binds all interfaces so an AirPlay receiver can reach it over the LAN, behind the per-session path token, a 32-connection cap with 24 for non-loopback peers, and a 10 s head deadline for unauthenticated connections), point `AVPlayer` at the playlist. Apple's stack does all decode, all HDR / Dolby Vision signaling over HDMI, all audio routing. This is the path for HEVC and progressive H.264, which is what AVPlayer's HLS-fMP4 pipeline reliably accepts (interlaced H.264 routes to the software path for deinterlacing, #107). Atmos passthrough, DV HDMI handshake, HDR10 / HDR10+ system-side tone-mapping all live on this path.

Why HLS-fMP4 for the native path instead of feeding `AVPlayer` the source URL directly: AVPlayer's progressive-download path won't accept arbitrary MKV containers, and even for MP4 sources it's brittle around Dolby Vision sample-description quirks and EAC3 `dec3` box variants. The HLS-fMP4 wrapper is the most permissive surface AVPlayer exposes; libavformat's `hls` muxer produces bytes byte-identical to `ffmpeg -f hls -hls_segment_type fmp4`, which is what Apple's HLS spec is defined against.

**Item diagnostics must not become playback work.** `accessLog()` and `errorLog()` can synchronously
wait on AVFoundation's media-service queues, even when called from an item notification. The video
host's log notifications and failure dump, the audio-only error observer, and outgoing-item counter
reconciliation therefore use `AVPlayerItemDiagnostics`: each reader owns its original item, coalesces
pending reasons, and delivers log values rather than native log objects to the main actor. Failure
track arrays are fetched off-main as well; the SDK's UI-actor-isolated track handles then use async
asset-property loaders. A stop/load invalidates publication, including queued callbacks, without
waiting for a read. Delivery rechecks ownership after synchronous log handlers and state subscribers,
which can replace the item while its diagnostic batch is being consumed. Coalesced error batches
examine unseen entries so an intervening fetch error
cannot hide the startup `-15628` loader-poison signal. Access-log notification output is capped at
five entries per item; a failure still dumps the complete available logs.

Admission is process-wide: at most **two concurrent diagnostic reads**, with **one pending retirement
read** retained beyond those lanes. Current-item/error work precedes optional retirement work.
Cancellation never releases a lane still inside a native getter; one stranded lane leaves the other
available, and two stranded lanes defer diagnostics rather than spawn more threads. This contains
diagnostic stalls, not an underlying media-server failure, and does not claim to make every other
AVPlayer operation nonblocking. Telemetry retains its existing separate, serial read path.

Same-session item swaps fold the outgoing item's last observed transferred-byte/dropped-frame totals
without a getter at the handover, then reconcile only the delta from its final background read.
Telemetry readings also refresh that cache, so an older diagnostic snapshot cannot move it backwards
or double-count the outgoing item. If swaps outpace blocked readers, an older unstarted retirement
read is discarded: its observed totals remain, but final totals are incomplete, reported once per
session rather than fabricated. A new playback session (including an episode handover on the same
player) clears those totals and rejects any old reconciliation.

The playlist's segment boundaries come from a keyframe-aligned plan that mirrors the `hls` muxer's cut algorithm (segment N ends at the first IRAP at-or-after `(N+1) * targetSegmentDuration`), built in `HLSVideoEngine+SegmentPlanning.swift`. It needs the source's keyframe positions, which for MKV / MP4 come from a brief cue prewarm (a bounded seek that loads the Cues / `stss` index) and for MPEG-TS / M2TS come only from whatever `avformat_find_stream_info` plus that seek happened to scan. `keyframeIndexIsTrustworthy` gates the plan on three witnesses before trusting that index, falling back to a uniform-stride plan otherwise: the largest **gap** between consecutive keyframes must stay under a cap (a clustered TS index gaps by thousands of seconds; trusting it builds a multi-thousand-second first segment the `frag_custom` muxer buffers whole in RAM, #64), and the **coverage** from first to last indexed keyframe must span at least one `targetSegmentDuration`. The coverage check catches a remote MKV whose Cues tail read fails: the prewarm loads nothing, only the open-time keyframes survive bunched in the first few seconds, their gaps are tiny so the gap check passes, yet no keyframe reaches the first segment boundary, so the keyframe planner would degenerate to a single whole-file segment AVPlayer loads zero tracks from (`kFigAssetError_TrackNotFound`, #91). The **tail** check requires that coverage to reach within 60 s of the source duration: a dense index that stops minutes short is a partial scan (an MKV whose Cues are missing or point past EOF leaves only what the capped prewarm walked), and trusting it cuts a last segment from the final scanned keyframe to the end of the title that the producer can never finish (PR #703). The uniform fallback anchors segment 0 at the content start so a late-starting title doesn't advertise empty leading segments.

At runtime the producer honors those boundaries with a keyframe-gated, decode-order cut (`VODSegmentCutter`): a segment opens only at the IRAP that reaches the next boundary, so the IRAP is the segment's first sample and its open-GOP leading pictures stay with it, matching the live path and the `hls` muxer. The earlier routing keyed each packet to a segment by its DTS against the PTS-valued boundaries, so under B-frame reorder a keyframe whose DTS trailed its PTS fell into the previous segment and the next one started mid-GOP, decode-dependent on its predecessor; a fresh decode at that boundary (rebuffer recovery) surfaced it as transient blocky corruption (#92).

Which timestamp "reaches" a boundary is a question about the CONTAINER, because the plan's boundaries ARE its index entries, and containers do not agree on what an entry means: a mov/mp4 sample table holds decode times, a Matroska Cue holds a presentation time. The gate therefore compares a packet on the plan's own axis (`PlanBoundaryAxis`, chosen from the demuxer's format name), and both mismatches have been paid for. A presentation packet against decode boundaries let a keyframe reach boundaries beyond its own by its composition offset (a couple of frames on an ordinary encode, 3 s on a remux carrying an edit list), consuming plan indices that never opened a segment while the playlist kept offering them (#358). A decode packet against presentation boundaries let no keyframe reach its own boundary at all, on every Matroska whose video carries composition offsets, which is every MKV with B-frames: the gate never opened on the planned IRAP, audio (routed by boundary, not gated) opened each segment instead, and every segment began mid-GOP roughly one IRAP below its own first random-access point. That is invisible while AVPlayer decodes THROUGH the boundaries and fatal the first time it has to decode FROM one, which it answers with `CoreMediaErrorDomain -19602` at a position that depends on the encode rather than on elapsed time (AE#561). `PlanBoundaryAxisTests` pins it on one HEVC stream muxed into both containers, where only the stamping differs.

Seeks are demand-driven: `AVPlayer` just fetches segments at the new position, and `VideoSegmentProvider` only tears the producer down and re-anchors it at the requested index (`restartHandler`, burst-coalesced by `RestartCoalescer`) when the request cannot be served from `SegmentCache`. A restart is the expensive path (it re-seeks the demuxer, slow on remote sources, #93), so for VOD the cache retains already-produced segments beyond its hard `[target - backwardWindow, target + forwardWindow]` window under a byte budget (2 GiB, clamped to a quarter of the tmp volume's free capacity), evicting farthest-from-target first once it fills. The hard window itself is never evicted, so that budget bounds only the extras around it, which holds by construction as long as the forward window stays at or below the historical 150-segment ceiling (~1.5 GB of 4K HEVC). A larger window is an explicit host opt-in into a whole-source prefetch (`LoadOptions.forwardBufferSegments`, up to 2700 segments ~ 3 h, #207): it drops the budget's 2 GiB default cap while keeping the quarter-of-free-space clamp, and the producer parks once its race-ahead owns that many bytes forward of the consumer target, resuming as eviction behind the playhead frees room (`PrefetchDiskBudget`). An opt-in prefetch therefore tracks the disk budget rather than the source length. A seek back into the retained span, and the forward march that follows it, is then a pure cache hit with zero producer restarts; only a seek into never-produced content restarts. Live sessions keep window-only pruning, since the sliding playlist has already dropped everything behind the window. When a non-disc VOD restart is required, it seeks on the video stream's native timestamp axis to the exact IRAP stored in the segment plan, with that timestamp as the lower bound; a global time seek can land a whole GOP earlier on multi-stream MP4 and turn the producer's scan-forward gate into a long remote read (#191). Disc plans use folded multi-clip timestamps and keep the global-time seek. Restarts on a slow link are further contained (#93 residual): a fetch that is waiting for an in-flight restart rides its progress instead of burning a fixed retry budget into a 503 (and never re-fires a restart at its own stale index), the wedged-restart fresh reopen skips `find_stream_info` (the session already holds saved codec configs and the segment plan), lazy native subtitle readers defer while a restart executes, and the FIRST producer of a resumed session anchors directly at the resume segment instead of producing seg0 into an immediate teardown. Retained scrub bands leave interior holes inside the cache's stored min/max index range, and residency there is not proof a segment exists: a fetch inside the range waits (2 s) only when the active producer's forward march actually covers the requested index, and restarts immediately otherwise (#129).

The public `seek(to:)` on the native path awaits AVPlayer's real landing so `isSeeking` spans it (#37/#38), but the wait is hard-bounded at 8 s (#65, #129): at the deadline the engine reconciles the published clock to AVPlayer's rendered frame and returns to the caller instead of stacking a second unbounded seek (repeated source stalls could chain those past 40 s). The original AVPlayer seek stays alive as the recovery intent (`pendingRecoverySeekClockTarget`): the producer is re-anchored at the target only when it is genuinely starved (a healthy-but-slow producer keeps its progress), the scrub clock is held while the intent is pending so recovery nudges cannot bounce it (#37), and a late landing settles the clock from the rendered frame, re-anchors subtitles once, and reconciles transport state after the fact; both orderings of the landing/deadline race on the MainActor are handled. Transport reconciles from live `timeControlStatus`, so an external AVKit / MediaRemote play or pause issued mid-seek wins, a spurious pause during active stall recovery is re-asserted inside the bounded recovery window, and a paused scrub still lands paused, never re-engaging playback (#122).

What a host observes about a seek comes in two shapes. `isSeeking` / `seekTarget` are the level: a seek is in flight, and where to. `seekEvents` is the stream that says what happened to it, because the level's falling edge is ambiguous by construction (#38 follow-up). Every accepted seek emits `.began` and exactly one of `.landed(renderedTime:)`, `.stalled` or `.superseded` under the same id, a seek that never reaches a host emits a standalone `.rejected`, and the one asymmetry is deliberate: a `.stalled` seek stays alive as recovery intent, so its `.landed` can still arrive minutes later on a source that finally serves the target, which is precisely the transition no level signal can express. Three paths feed it. Programmatic seeks report from their finalize, so the clock is already at the target when the event fires. Seeks stashed before the session can take them (#127/#178) hold the level for the whole stash window, because the engine publishes their target on `currentTime` optimistically and a consumer that broadcasts it needs to know nothing has reached it. Native AVKit scrubs end their window when the PICTURE reaches the restarted region, watched on `$renderedTime` and bounded at 8 s, not when the coalesced producer restart drains: draining means the producer is producing at the new index, and the picture arrives a fetch and a decode later (1.4 s on a WAN source in the reporting host's capture). A restart that a programmatic seek itself caused is left to that seek's events, since the restart segment can sit below where the picture ends up.

Restart latency is self-localizing (#93 follow-up): the "producer restarted" line carries a phase split (`stopWait/reopen/seek/build`), a producer's FIRST source read is timed, and any single `AVIOReader` read exceeding 2 s emits one `slow read` summary naming where the time went (detour fetches with network time, `connStallTimeout` waits, reconnects, backoff sleeps, bytes dropped by the stale-generation guard, generation span). A slow read with all-zero counters means the wait was upstream of the read loop.

A restart-window request must also never leave AVPlayer waiting in silence (#93 round 3): AVPlayer's media watchdog logs `-12889 "No response for media file"` after ~3.5 s without response HEADERS (holding the connection open does not help), and three strikes fail the item. A VOD serve still running at 2 s (`SlowServeSignal` armed by `VideoSegmentProvider.mediaSegment(at:onSlow:)`) therefore emits an early `200` with `Transfer-Encoding: chunked`; the segment follows as a single chunk when it lands, and a serve that ultimately misses aborts the connection (truncated transfer, AVPlayer retries) instead of framing a cacheable empty 200. Fast serves keep the byte-identical `Content-Length` response. If the item dies anyway, `failedToPlayToEndTime` parks it at rate 0 / `timeControlStatus == .paused` (with `item.status` often still `readyToPlay`), which every pause-guarded recovery layer used to misread as user intent, making the session terminal. The host now counts loopback-path end failures (`endFailureCount`), and the engine confirms the death through the same deferred window as the `.failed` KVO, then reloads the item through the stage-2 chain with the pause guard bypassed, bounded by `ItemDeathReviveGate` (3 attempts per dead spot; playback progress or a user seek away restores the budget). The fresh item resumes only if the host's play intent says the viewer was playing: a paused title whose item dies (a tvOS screensaver taking the display is one way) is reloaded and stays paused.

When a restart does run, it must reproduce segments on the SAME media timeline the continuous run gave them: the loopback's contract with AVPlayer is "static VOD server", and AVPlayer anchors fMP4 segments by their `tfdt`. Each restart allocates a fresh mp4 muxer, and movenc zero-bases a new instance's timeline by default, so a restart-produced segment used to carry `tfdt=0` while the playlist placed it at its plan offset: an implicit timeline discontinuity on every restart, papered over for plain playback but fatal to ancillary consumers (AVKit's legible renderer detaches mid-PiP, Sodalite#32; playhead/loaded-range decoupling, #93). The muxer therefore sets `movflags +frag_discont` with `avoid_negative_ts=disabled` so `tfdt` carries the producer's absolute output timestamps, the restart audio gate inherits the session shift (video shift rescaled) instead of snapping audio onto the video seam, and leading head-of-stream audio that would map below 0 is dropped (the muxer no longer absorbs negative timestamps). A restarted segment is byte-identical to its continuous twin modulo the per-muxer `mfhd` sequence number (pinned by `RestartTimelineContinuityTests` on a committed A/V fixture); on matroska sources, per-sample DTS synthesis after a demuxer seek scatters the DTS decomposition and boundary-frame membership by a frame or two, but presentation timestamps and `tfdt` anchoring stay epoch-invariant. Because `tfdt` carries `unsigned int(64)`, that same setting makes a negative output axis unrepresentable rather than merely unusual, so the published first timestamp is clamped at zero (AE#509): libavformat serves an MPEG-TS whose first DTS sits within 60 s of the 33-bit PTS wrap with every timestamp `2^33` ticks low (`AV_PTS_WRAP_SUB_OFFSET`), and a live join there published `baseMediaDecodeTime = 2^64 - |dts|` against a playlist starting at 0, which AVPlayer answers by fetching the whole window and placing none of it, with no error and no stall of its own.

### Software decoder pipeline (AV1 + VP9 + VP8 + legacy fallback)

Demux the source, run video packets through libavcodec (dav1d for AV1, FFmpeg's native decoder for VP9 / VP8 / MPEG-4 Part 2 / MPEG-2 / VC-1) into `CVPixelBuffer`s, run audio through libavcodec into `CMSampleBuffer`s, render via `AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer` + `AVSampleBufferAudioRenderer` with `AVSampleBufferRenderSynchronizer` as the master clock. Used for codecs AVPlayer's HLS-fMP4 pipeline doesn't accept: AV1 (no Apple TV currently ships an AV1 hardware decoder, and Apple bundles dav1d only on iOS / macOS, so AV1 always routes here today; the engine still registers the supplemental VideoToolbox AV1 decoder and gates on `VTIsHardwareDecodeSupported` (`VTCapabilityProbe`), so a future Apple TV chip with HW AV1 is picked up automatically), VP9 / VP8 (AVPlayer parses the HLS manifest, sees `vp09` / `vp08` in the CODECS attribute, then silently stops fetching. `item.status` never leaves `.unknown`. VideoToolbox HW-decodes VP9 fine, but only outside the HLS pipeline), and legacy MPEG-4 Part 2 (XVID / DIVX / SP / ASP), MPEG-2 video, and VC-1 (none of `mp4v.20.X` / `mp2v` / `vc-1` are in Apple's HLS Authoring Spec CODECS list). Interlaced H.264 also routes here (`VideoRoutingPolicy`, keyed on the declared field order), because AVPlayer does not deinterlace and 1080i / 576i broadcast would comb; the SW path runs it through `DeinterlaceFilter` (#107). On seekable VOD that declaration is verified against decoded frames first (`InterlaceProbe`, #232): the filter engages on `AV_FRAME_FLAG_INTERLACED` alone, so a sample in which that flag never appears proves the detour would be a no-op and the stream goes back to the native path.

A seek holds the last frame on screen rather than blanking it. `SampleBufferRenderer.flush()` takes a `removingDisplayedImage` flag and hands it straight to `AVSampleBufferVideoRenderer.flush(removingDisplayedImage:)`: stop/teardown clears the visible frame (the default), but `SoftwarePlaybackHost.seek()` passes `false`, so the previous frame stays up until the post-seek keyframe decodes instead of flashing black on slow sources like MPEG-2. This matches the native/AVPlayer path, which holds the frame through a seek (#90).

**The channel layout on that same format description has to name the order the resampler wrote** (#401). `AudioDecoder` resamples into `makeResamplerOutputLayout`'s layout and stamps `audioChannelLayoutTag`'s tag, and if the two disagree the renderer places audio where the decoder never put it: measured per channel, the earlier pairing moved every channel of a 7.1 track and placed the LFE hard left at full gain, put a 4.0 centre hard left, and mixed a 2.1 LFE into both channels instead of dropping it. Only 5.0 and 5.1 lined up, which is why it went unseen. The two functions therefore live side by side and a test holds them against each other, once structurally and once by rendering each channel through a real downmix. 6.1 is the single count CoreAudio has no matching tag for, so the resampler is pointed at 6.1(back) rather than leaving the well-trodden tags for a `UseChannelDescriptions` layout.

`AudioDecoder` stamps each `CMSampleBuffer` from a running sample count anchored to the first frame (`AudioClockAnchor`), not from the container-quantized per-packet PTS. Container timebases are coarse (1 ms in MKV), so when a frame's duration is not an integer number of ticks (a 1536-sample AC-3 frame is 34.83 ms at 44.1 kHz but exactly 32 ms at 48 kHz) the quantized PTS leave a sub-millisecond gap or overlap at every buffer boundary, and `AVSampleBufferAudioRenderer` reconciles a discontinuity at each one (~29 clicks/sec, a continuous crackle). Anchoring to the sample clock makes consecutive buffers abut exactly; a real source discontinuity (> 100 ms off the predicted clock, i.e. a seek or edit) re-anchors so genuine gaps are not papered over, and `flush()` drops the anchor. The clock advances only on a successfully emitted buffer, so a dropped buffer injects no phantom samples.

AV1+DV (Profile 10.0 / 10.1 / 10.4) routes through the native path on hardware-AV1 hosts via the `dav1` / `av01` track type plus the source's `dvvC` box. AV1+Atmos is genuinely rare in the wild (mastering still runs in HEVC overwhelmingly), so the SW pipeline's lack of Atmos passthrough is a theoretical limitation rather than a real one. AV1 capability registration is lazy and runs only when routing an AV1 source; loading H.264, HEVC or audio-only content does not consult it. The dispatch happens once at load time; hosts see a unified `@Published` state surface either way.

**Background audio (iOS).** When the app backgrounds while playing, the engine keeps audio going rather than tearing the pipeline down. The decision is a pure, unit-tested policy, `backgroundAction(isAudioBackend:hasSoftwareHost:keepVideoAlive:state:)`, driven from the `UIApplication` lifecycle observers; `keepVideoAlive` comes from `shouldKeepVideoAlive(enabled:pipActive:state:)` and is gated to iOS (tvOS always tears down, wedge-safe: a frozen decode session crossing a multi-hour suspension wedged `mediaserverd`). On the native path "keep audio alive" is just declining to tear down: `AVPlayer` under the `.playback` session keeps decoding. The software path has no `AVPlayer`, and its combined demux loop normally paces the whole loop (audio and video) on the video renderer's `isReadyForMoreMediaData`; once `AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer` stops draining in the background that gate never reopens and audio would starve. So the host enters `backgroundAudioOnly`: the loop drops video packets and paces on the audio renderer (`AudioOutput.isReadyForMoreMediaData`) instead, keeping `AVSampleBufferAudioRenderer` fed and the synchronizer advancing. On foreground return the flag clears, the video decoder and renderer flush, and video resyncs at the next keyframe with audio uninterrupted. Scope is the combined VOD loop (and live-without-DVR, which shares it); the DVR feeder loop is unchanged. Exercise it headless with `aetherctl bgaudio` (see [cli.md](cli.md)).

**Live audio look-ahead + edge rebuffer (#107 audio chopping).** The DVR feeder loop shares the pacing coupling above: audio is interleaved behind the video renderer's back-pressure gate, so the audio renderer could never hold more than the video queue allows (<1 s measured). On devices where software 1080i decode + deinterlace runs near real time that margin is zero and every feeder stall is an audible dropout. The feeder therefore runs an audio look-ahead pump (`AudioLookaheadPolicy` + `AudioLookaheadState`): an independent ring cursor that decodes and enqueues audio packets ahead of the combined cursor until the renderer holds `targetLeadSeconds` (4 s) over the synchronizer clock, making audio delivery independent of video decode pace (a chronically slow video decode now degrades to late video frames under smooth audio, the right priority). DVR seeks reset the pump cursor alongside `setFeedCursor` (compare-and-set, seek wins). The same pump pass handles live-edge source underruns: when the source itself delivers below real time and the pump drains the ring at the edge, the free-running clock would otherwise outrun the stream permanently (every later sample lands in the clock's past, continuous chopping that never recovers). `AudioLookaheadPolicy.clockAction` pauses the clock at `underrunPauseLeadSeconds`, refills, and resumes at `rebufferResumeLeadSeconds`, mirroring AVPlayer's stall handling on the native path. A host seek does not ask the pump to do that on purpose: a software live landing nearer the reader's frontier than `rebufferResumeLeadSeconds` is held that far back (`AetherEngine.softwareLiveLanding`, Sodalite#104 round 3), because on a real-time source the lead arrives exactly as slowly as it is deep, so a landing at the frontier parks the clock for that long and resumes at the same distance behind it that the held-back landing starts from. Diagnose with `aetherctl play --audio-stats` (see [cli.md](cli.md)).

**Paused-background grace window (iOS, #127).** A paused session used to tear down the moment the app backgrounded, so a 10-30 s app switch paid a full pipeline rebuild (demuxer reopen, segment-plan scan, AVPlayer item reload). The teardown is now deferred by `backgroundTeardownGraceSeconds` (default 15 s, 0 restores the immediate teardown) held under a `UIBackgroundTask` assertion; `didBecomeActive` cancels the window, so a quick switch resumes on the live pipeline. At expiry the action is re-evaluated (PiP can start and lock-screen play can resume mid-window) and the teardown runs while the app is still genuinely running, never across an idle suspension; the assertion's expiration handler is a synchronous backstop. The step decision is the pure `backgroundStep(action:state:supportsGraceWindow:graceSeconds:)`; a PLAYING teardown (background playback disabled) stays immediate because its audio would keep sounding through the window, and tvOS keeps the unconditional teardown. Two hardening pieces ship with it: host seeks that arrive while the (re)built AVPlayer item is pre-ready are deferred (`shouldDeferHostSeek`) and the latest replays at readiness (an early seek clamps to 0 against empty seekable ranges and replaces `load()`'s own startPosition seek), and hosts observe the published `isSessionReady` to gate corrective actions (restore watchdogs, position clamps) instead of inferring readiness from `currentTime` being pinned at 0.

**What a teardown hands the reload that follows it (#357).** Every reload path snapshots the state it restores (the #170 subtitle carryover, the audio pick, the disc title) immediately before its own `stopInternal`. That contract holds only while teardown and reload are the same call, which the background path is not: it tears down when the app sleeps and reloads on foreground return, so the reload's snapshot ran long after the state it wanted was wiped and it restored nothing. For subtitles that leaves the rebuilt session without a drain target, so no cue is delivered and every delivery instrument stays silent, which reads as a delivery defect rather than a lost selection; only an explicitly picked track died, because an auto-picked one came back through the reload's re-run preferred-language selection. The teardown now parks a `BackgroundTeardownSelection` before `stopInternal` and `reloadAtCurrentPosition` claims it once. The live read stays authoritative for what survives a teardown (the external registry, its ordinal counter, the host's subtitle authority) and for a selection made after it, which is newer intent; the snapshot fills only the fields the teardown wiped.

The same seam owns one object, not just state: the background teardown keeps the `NativeAVPlayerHost` shell alive (`keepNativeHost`), because AVKit registers its MediaRemote Now-Playing client once per `AVPlayer` instance and never registers again against a swapped one (issue #15). The reload on the way back decides whether to keep it with `shouldPreserveNativeHostAcrossLoad(backend:nativeHostSurvives:)`, which asks whether a host is still there rather than which backend is running: the teardown leaves `playbackBackend` at `.none`, so reading the backend alone discarded exactly the instance the teardown had preserved, and the viewer came back from a tvOS screensaver to playing video with a dead system Now-Playing card (Sodalite#149). A load that then routes software or audio-only releases the preserved host in its own dispatch branch.

### Audio-only pipeline (music, podcasts, audiobooks)

When the host sets `LoadOptions.audioOnly`, the engine skips the video machinery entirely: no HLS loopback server, no segment producer, no display layer. Decode is native-first. Codecs on the `avPlayerCanDecodeAudio` whitelist hand the source URL straight to a bare `AVPlayer` (`AudioAVPlayerHost`); everything else demuxes through libavformat and decodes through libavcodec into an `AVSampleBufferAudioRenderer` (`AudioPlaybackHost`). Transport (`play` / `pause` / `seek`) routes to the active host, and `stopInternal` tears it down for a clean handoff back to the video path on the next load.

```
audioOnly == true
   ├─ whitelisted codec ──► AVPlayer (AudioAVPlayerHost) ──► AVR / speakers
   └─ otherwise          ──► Demuxer ──► AudioDecoder ──► AVSampleBufferAudioRenderer ──► AVR / speakers
```

On tvOS and iOS the AVPlayer audio host owns a persistent per-player `MPNowPlayingSession` (exposed via `audioNowPlayingSession`) so the system Now-Playing overlay stays bound to the app across a background pause, auto-publishes now-playing info from the player, and carries `externalMetadata`. The host survives across tracks and does not pause when the app backgrounds. All of this is gated `#if os(tvOS) || os(iOS)`; on macOS the path compiles and plays without the system session (a macOS host drives Now-Playing through the shared centers itself).

The native VIDEO host can own the same kind of session, but only on request (`ownsVideoNowPlayingSession`, default off, read when a host is created). The asymmetry is deliberate: the audio path is always a bare AVPlayer, whereas the video player is consumed both by custom-transport hosts and by `AVPlayerViewController` hosts, and AVKit owns Now-Playing there through its own private registration. A session claimed underneath AVKit costs that host its identity card and its working transport commands, so ownership is the host's call. When it is taken, the session lives on `NativeAVPlayerHost` and therefore survives native->native reloads with it (issue #15), and `setVideoNowPlayingInfo(_:)` stages the identity dictionary that is replayed onto every fresh `AVPlayerItem` (readiness-gate master reloads, media fallback, in-place PiP swaps).

### Audio tap (#95)

`installAudioTap()` returns an `AsyncStream<AudioTapBuffer>` of decoded playback audio: mono Float32 48 kHz (`AetherEngine.audioTapFormat`), stamped with source-PTS seconds (`sourceTime`, same axis as `engine.sourceTime`), with a `discontinuity` flag on any gap (seek, eviction, track switch, drops under pressure). Intended for host-side speech features (live transcription via SpeechAnalyzer) and audio recognition (ShazamKit signatures).

Native path: a loopback reader (`LoopbackAudioReader`) pulls the engine's own muxed fMP4 segments from the segment cache near the playhead and decodes their audio track out-of-band (libavcodec + libswresample, fresh per-segment demux context). Because it reads the mux, it follows the active audio track for free (the mux contains exactly the selected track, post-bridge), adds zero network load, and cannot stall playback by construction. Remote-HLS path (direct AVPlayer ingest, no loopback, VOD and live): `AudioTapHLSVariantResolver` picks the active audio rendition / muxed variant, `AudioTapHLSFetcher` fetches and decrypts (AES-128 clear-key) self-contained TS / fMP4 segments (sending `LoadOptions.httpHeaders`, same as the player's asset, #119), and a playhead-follow reader (`AudioTapHLSReader`) decodes them near the playhead; `AudioTapReaderSelection` makes the per-session reader choice, and `audioTapHasDeliverySource` tells the host whether the current session can deliver at all (fail-loud). Software path: the existing `AudioDecoder` PCM output is mirrored through an `AVAudioConverter` sink on `SoftwarePlaybackHost`. That decoder emits the source channel layout up to 7.1 without downmixing, so the sink takes its input format from the sample buffer's own channel layout (the channel-count-only `AVAudioFormat` initializer returns nil for every count above 2) and verifies once per format that the converter really mixes it down: some layouts (measured: 4ch Quadraphonic and any discrete layout) convert to digital silence without reporting an error, and those are folded to mono inside the tap instead (#400). One tap per engine; re-install replaces the previous stream, and `load()` / `stop()` finish it (opt-in is per load; with no session or a video-only source the stream finishes immediately). A session-preserving reload finishes it too (audio / subtitle / disc-title switch, `reloadAtCurrentPosition`): every delivery path is bound to the session it was installed against, and each install gets a fresh `AudioTapMonotonicFilter`, so a host re-installs on stream end and starts the new session on a clean timeline rather than one stitched across a reload that resumes slightly behind the old position (#356). Delivery is lossy under pressure (`bufferingNewest(64)`); live sources are best-effort.

```

software ──► AudioDecoder CMSampleBuffers ──► AVAudioConverter (mono 48k) ──► AsyncStream
```

### Playback status (`playbackPhase`)

`AetherEngine.playbackPhase` is the single observable for what playback is doing right now, across all three pipelines. It is *derived*, not a parallel state machine: a pure fold of `state`, `isBuffering`, `isSeeking`, and a typed source-reconnect axis, recomputed on every input change so it can never desync from them. Each input's `didSet` triggers an idempotent recompute that re-emits only on an actual change.

Precedence (highest first): `error > ended > idle > loading > stalled > seeking > rebuffering > playing/paused`.

The reader axis outranks `isSeeking` (#410). A seek cannot land over a source that stopped delivering, so the level stays up for as long as the seek stays alive, and the seek holding it is not necessarily the host's: the producer's restart coalescer issues its own `nativeScrub` seeks while recovering, so the engine's recovery used to hide the outage it was recovering from (measured at 29 s and 41 s on a killed LAN origin). A seek stays observable through `isSeeking` and `seekEvents`; the reader axis is observable nowhere else. Over a delivering source nothing changes: the reader is `flowing` and a seek reads `.seeking` exactly as before.

- `.rebuffering` is a healthy-connection buffer underrun (AVPlayer waiting to play); `state` stays `.playing` across it.
- `.stalled(reconnecting:)` is a source-connection problem (drop / 429 / 503 backoff) where the `AVIOReader` is retrying. It is promoted from log text to a typed signal: the reader pushes a `flowing` / `reconnecting` phase through `Demuxer.onNetworkPhaseChanged`, the owning host (`HLSVideoEngine` on the native path, the software / audio hosts directly) forwards it, and the engine hops it to the main actor. The flag is `true` while the reader is retrying and `false` once it has spent its ladder (#410): the reader is out of the read, the producer's reopen owns the recovery, and the source is still down. Before that the dying reader claimed `flowing` on its way out, purely so the next reader's dedupe gate could not strand the phase, and the whole reopen window read as a healthy source.

Only bytes that crossed the network move the axis back to `flowing` (#410), the same line the reconnect ladders have drawn since #380: a serve out of the resident window, the retained head/tail spans (#281) or a resident detour block hands back read-ahead the origin paid for before it died, and reporting delivery off it erased the stall on the next read. A metered detour fetch (429 / 503 / 509 on the arm that carries a throttling origin, #69/#71) now reports `reconnecting` and its give-up reports `exhausted`; it charged the ladder but told the axis nothing. One deliberate exception remains: the faulted-runway refill (#307/#309) replaces a dead connection while megabytes are still resident and stays silent, because playback there is uninterrupted; the empty-window ladder reports it when playback genuinely starves. The native text subtitle readers (WebVTT rendition prefetch) are deliberately left unwired so their stalls never move `playbackPhase`; the overlay itself is fed from the main read via the subtitle packet tap and has no connection of its own.
- The direct AVPlayer-HLS live path (`nativeRemoteHLS`) and the whitelisted-codec audio host (`AudioAVPlayerHost`) have no demuxer / `AVIOReader`, so they cannot report `.stalled`; a starved connection there reads as `.rebuffering`. On the audio host that flag is folded from AVPlayer's own signals, `timeControlStatus == .waitingToPlayAtSpecifiedRate` and `AVPlayerItemPlaybackStalled`, and only once the item has played: the pre-roll wait of a fresh track is startup, not a rebuffer, and a paused player is never one. Up to and including 6.30.1 the audio host fed no buffering axis at all, so a dead progressive stream (an internet-radio origin dropping the connection) stayed `.playing` with a frozen clock and a host had nothing but the clock to watch.

Hosts should observe `$playbackPhase` instead of combining `state == .loading`, `$isBuffering`, and `$isSeeking`, and instead of regex-matching `EngineLog` for stall / reconnect, which is no longer needed.

### Effective video route (`videoRoute`)

`LoadOptions.nativeRemoteHLS` records what the host asked for. It is not what ends up serving the session: the engine reroutes on its own findings, and `playbackBackend` cannot tell the two native pipelines apart because both are `.native`. `AetherEngine.videoRoute` publishes the pipeline actually running, derived the same way `playbackPhase` is (a pure fold over `playbackBackend` and the session's effective options, recomputed from each one's `didSet`, re-emitted only on a real change), so it cannot become a second opinion about the session.

- `.remoteBypass` is AVPlayer on the origin URL: no demuxer, no local server. AVFoundation owns media selection, buffering, and subtitle drawing.
- `.loopback` is the demuxer plus the local HLS-fMP4 server, the default video route. The engine owns the source connection and the subtitle pipeline.
- `.software`, `.audio` and `.none` mirror the corresponding backends.

Routes the host did not ask for:

| Transition | Trigger |
| --- | --- |
| `.remoteBypass` -> `.loopback` | #168 carriage watchdog: readyToPlay, but no video track for a master that advertises one (HEVC in MPEG-TS). Mid-session. |
| `.remoteBypass` -> `.loopback` | #199: the same master's verdict is remembered, so the next load skips the doomed mount entirely. At load time. |
| `.remoteBypass` -> `.loopback` | AE#268: the playlist plus the first segment's PMT identify a finite HEVC-in-MPEG-TS VOD. At load time. |
| `.loopback` -> `.remoteBypass` | AE#154 / AE#246: an HLS playlist reached the loopback path, which cannot demux it. At load time. |

Branch on this where host behaviour differs per pipeline: who draws subtitles (AVPlayer on the bypass, the host's renderer on loopback and software), and whether a composited PiP overlay is meaningful at all. Observing it also makes the mid-session reroute an event rather than a log line.

## Software VOD compressed packet cache

Seekable software VOD read through one of the engine's byte readers has a
compressed packet producer separate from the renderer-paced decode consumer. The
producer stores lossless packet envelopes in a session-owned temporary disk FIFO.
Envelopes preserve payload, PTS/DTS, packet duration, position, flags, stream
index, time base and every side-data entry; neither decoded pictures nor source
URLs are retained in metadata. A source libavformat opens itself, which is a
local path, stays on the direct loop: the spool exists to avoid a second trip to
a source, and re-reading a file is a page-cache hit.

The host uses the existing `forwardBufferSegments` clamp and native session
retention/volume-safety policy. The forward-second limit is measured on the
reservoir, from the packet the consumer last took to the newest one stored,
because that is what the producer is building and two timestamps always say it.
The coverage frontier below answers a stricter question and reports nothing at
all once a hole or a single late presentation timestamp invalidates it, so it
cannot be the only thing holding the limit up. Byte and forward-time thresholds
stop prefetch, with bounded protected-chunk and single-record slack. Old consumed chunks can
be reclaimed at the exact budget boundary so refill cannot deadlock. Metadata
reads and seek intent are main-thread safe; disk operations and source reads
stay on workers. Stop releases the session's directory, and bounded stale
cleanup uses session leases without following symlinks or deleting live stores.
If creating the store fails, the original direct playback loop remains available.
Runtime cache corruption is a reported playback failure, not silently skipped data.

The cache frontier is the intersection of selected audio and video presentation
coverage containing the playhead. Unknown intervals remain unknown; byte counts
are not converted to guessed seconds. H.264 and HEVC use a bounded presentation
reorder queue and confirmed successor timestamps, because a VFR packet's decode
duration can be shorter than the picture's actual display hold, and a container
that rounds durations down (41 ms against 41/42 ms deltas at 23.976 fps) would
otherwise split the coverage at every frame (#613). Larger discontinuities,
invalid or unexpectedly late timestamps invalidate or split coverage. Other
codecs retain strict packet-duration coverage. Coverage keeps its history behind
the playhead for backward cached seeks, up to 4096 ranges per stream; a full
coverage forgets the ranges wholly behind the playhead rather than stop
describing new packets. Without a proven compressed frontier, the existing
decoded-cushion fallback still applies.

A cached seek restores a retained keyframe cursor, including an earlier keyframe
for available preroll, and keeps the producer at its existing source frontier.
A cache miss clears coverage and repositions the demuxer; discarding the spool
is the worker's job, not the seek's, because removing every retained chunk costs
more the longer the session has kept them and no seek waits on that work.
Consumer generations
and source epochs are separate: a cached seek must not discard an in-flight
producer packet, and a superseded consumer must not steal the first packet of a
new source epoch. Admission applies equally to packet, EOF, error and delayed
end-of-media callbacks. At EOF the VOD consumer parks until a new seek or stop.

This changes engine cache semantics, not host UI. Software `bufferedPosition`
and `LiveTelemetry.cachedBytes` describe compressed coverage/residency;
`forwardBufferSeconds` remains the native player's loaded-range metric and
`displayCushionSeconds` still describes the small decoded queue. Native HLS
`residentRanges` and live DVR are not repurposed.

The producer owns a thread rather than a dispatch queue, because a queue's QoS
is fixed at creation while this producer's urgency changes inside one
long-running loop. It starts latency-critical, drops to the efficiency class
once the reserve reaches half the forward window, and returns to
latency-critical at a quarter of it, the instant a consumer parks in a read, or
whenever the reserve cannot be expressed in seconds at all, which is the state a
cold start and a seek landing are both in. The two depths differ so a source
sitting on one threshold does not retune once per packet. A permanently demoted
producer is an inversion the scheduler cannot see, since the consumer waits on
an `NSCondition` and a condition donates no priority to the thread it waits for,
and it was measured costing throughput rather than only fairness: on an idle
8-core M1 with the consumer's decode cost made negligible, the efficiency-class
producer drained 147 MB of an 80 Mbit/s source in 60 s where the responsive one
drained 438 MB, with seven cores free the whole time. Lifting only the thread's
disk-I/O policy on the same class restored it to 528 MB, which names the cause:
the class throttles the spool writes the producer makes for every packet, so the
effect needs no contention for cycles. The adaptive choice keeps what the
demotion was for; over a 100 s steady state it retains 2165 ms of
efficiency-class CPU against 2145 ms for a permanently demoted producer and 1 ms
for a permanently responsive one, at identical total CPU. Consumer starvation is
reported as its own rate-limited line, so a source that cannot keep up is
readable instead of inferred from a stalled clock.

The CI packet-cache step runs the standalone coverage, VFR successor, disk FIFO,
read-ahead concurrency, host admission and AVPacket-envelope regressions. These
use generated numeric data and temporary records, not private video fixtures.

## SwiftUI `Menu` in custom player chrome

On tvOS 26, the focused row of an open SwiftUI `Menu` blinks whenever any SwiftUI render transaction runs in the hosting tree, even one fully contained in an unrelated leaf view (a `TimelineView(.periodic)` wall clock, a playbar observing `engine.clock`, a subtitle overlay). Minimal repro: a `Menu` next to a `TimelineView(.periodic(from: .now, by: 1))`, open the menu, the focused item blinks once per second. This is a SwiftUI issue, not an engine one; reported to Apple by an AetherEngine adopter (see [AetherEngine#29](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/issues/29)).

The engine keeps its own surfaces out of the blast radius by splitting every continuously ticking value off the engine's `ObservableObject` (`engine.clock` at ~10 Hz, `engine.diagnostics` at 1 Hz). But a player UI always has something ticking, so if your custom chrome needs a dropdown while playback runs, build the menu button in UIKit and let SwiftUI host it. `UIButton` with `button.menu` + `showsMenuAsPrimaryAction` renders the same system menu as SwiftUI's `Menu` (public API since tvOS 17), and a `UIViewRepresentable` wrapper can guarantee the open dropdown is never rebuilt:

```swift
struct TrackMenuButton: UIViewRepresentable {
    let items: [TrackMenuItem]

    func makeUIView(context: Context) -> UIButton { /* configure once */ }

    func updateUIView(_ button: UIButton, context: Context) {
        // Same-value reassignment tears down an open dropdown. Only
        // replace the UIMenu when the items actually changed.
        if context.coordinator.currentItems != items {
            context.coordinator.currentItems = items
            button.menu = buildMenu(from: items)
        }
    }
}
```

SwiftUI diffing can re-run `updateUIView` as often as it likes; the guard means an open menu only rebuilds on a real item change. Credit to [@ohjey](https://github.com/ohjey) for isolating the mechanism and the pattern (AetherEngine#29).

## Blocking work and the cooperative pool

Engine code that blocks its thread (a demuxer open or packet read, a FIFO write under
backpressure, a `close()` that joins a pump, a `waitForFinish`) never runs on the Swift
cooperative pool. That pool has one thread per core and does not grow, so each blocked job takes
a core's worth of async work out of the whole process, the host app's included. A detached engine
task is therefore created through `BlockingWork.detached` (`BlockingWork.swift`), never
`Task.detached`: the task prefers `BlockingExecutor`, which runs its jobs on GCD's global queues,
and GCD adds a thread when one blocks. The task otherwise behaves as before (it awaits, hops to
the main actor, is cancelled). `BlockingWorkTests` pins both halves, and a test fails the build
of any `Task.detached` that comes back into `Sources/AetherEngine`.

The trigger was CI: on a 3-core runner the suite parked all three pool threads for half a minute
at a time, until a 120 s time limit fired at 151 s because its watchdog is a task on the same
pool. `LIBDISPATCH_COOPERATIVE_POOL_STRICT=1` narrows the pool to one thread and reproduces that
on any Mac; the full suite has to pass under it.

## Subtitle recognition scheduling

Bitmap subtitle OCR awaits each image's recognition on a dedicated utility thread.
`VNImageRequestHandler.perform` blocks while Vision completes its own work; calling it directly
from a Swift task, even `Task.detached`, can exhaust the cooperative executor. Embedded and
sidecar OCR workers therefore suspend during recognition rather than occupying that executor.
One process-wide admission slot stays occupied until the native operation actually returns,
including after cancellation. Cancelled queued callers leave without starting another thread.
Completed cues remain in the store; an embedded worker cancelled mid-batch invalidates that
batch's advanced cursor so re-selection collects it again rather than skipping unfinished cues.

│   ├── AVIOReader.swift                     URLSession-backed avio_alloc_context, three modes: persistent forward-streaming connection with reconnect-on-drop (playback, incl. live), discrete Range chunks (still extraction), single sequential GET with backpressure (non-live sources without Content-Length). Optional read deadline bounds a degenerate matroska Cues seek. Cold start on a non-faststart MP4 keeps the open window across the parse seek to the trailing moov (so the return trip to the first sample is a copy, not a third connection) and issues one speculative 64 KB suffix range alongside the open, rejected at the response header unless it is a well-formed 206. A read landing in that range waits for the fetch rather than connecting past it, bounded by the measured cost of one round trip against the origin, because the demuxer reaches the tail before a fetch issued at the same instant can land (#281). A suffix-range denial is remembered per origin only from the origin's answer to the range form (a 200, a 416), never from a 403/404/429/5xx; a source refused with an HTTP status fails the open typed (`AVIOReaderError.httpStatus`) instead of handing FFmpeg the error page (#378). A post-redirect target is pinned from its first 2xx and dropped again on an auth-expiry status, on an unproductive-reconnect streak, and on a bounded grace of rate-limited attempts (#307/#380); a pin that has carried no bytes for a minute is dropped by its FIRST refusal instead, because the lingering-slot 509 that grace exists for cannot arise with nothing of ours in flight (#392)

Per-open `DemuxerOpenProfile` budgets `find_stream_info` (probesize / max_analyze_duration), caller-overridable on the main playback open via `LoadOptions.probesize` / `maxAnalyzeDuration`. The native text readers' side demuxer sets `skipStreamInfo` to drop the `find_stream_info` pass entirely (codec_id / codec_type come from the container header / PMT at open); the reader runs a bounded `resolveStreamInfo()` on demand only if its target stream's codec is genuinely unresolved at open (#87)

│   ├── SubtitleHarvestCoverage.swift        Which spans of the source the harvest runs actually read, one span per run, anchored where a reader positioned and extended as it goes. A PGS set claims the landing by the store being empty between it and the playhead; over ground nobody read that silence is not evidence, and the packets alone cannot tell the two apart (#416, the ledger #362 round 2 named and left unbuilt)
│   ├── SubtitleOverlayDrainer.swift         Playhead-paced decode planning for the overlay: reads packets from the store near the playhead into the existing apply path, so stale-arrival gate, trim state machine and retention stay playhead-relative (#112 rework); `harvestGapCut` stops a tick where the store's harvest ORDER breaks rather than where its gaps are widest, so a hole a restarted pump has not filled yet is waited on instead of skipped past forever (#362)
│   ├── SubtitleForwardPrefetcher.swift      VOD-only subtitle side reader filling the same store up to playhead + drain lead, past the producer's own forward park, so a host ADVANCE sync offset finds cues (#151)
│   ├── SideReaderLinkPolicy.swift           Who gets the source link when the video path and a subtitle side reader want it at once: on Matroska a "subtitle-only" reader still pulls every block off the wire, so the video path has priority with a bounded grace and a yield ceiling (#240)
│   ├── SubtitleImageOCR.swift               On-device recognition of bitmap subtitle images (PGS / DVB / DVD) into plain-text cues for the native rendition; lossy by design, the fullscreen overlay keeps the pixel-accurate bitmaps
│   ├── SubtitleOCRPendingState.swift        Pending-composition end resolution for the OCR worker, mirroring the sidecar semantics: a composition still open at the next composition or clear event ends at that event's PTS
│   ├── WebVTTCueSettings.swift              WebVTT cue settings (`line`, `position`, `align`) mapped onto `SubtitleTextPlacement`: libavcodec's decoder drops them from the ASS line it synthesises, the demuxer keeps them as packet side data (#233)
│   └── WebVTTSegmentParser.swift            One parsed WebVTT segment of a live SUBTITLES rendition: cue times are in the segment's own local clock (a counter providers run for days), and placement comes from the playlist geometry rather than the `X-TIMESTAMP-MAP` the spec offers (#359)

The `AetherEngineSMB` product is a separate, opt-in target so its SMBClient (MIT) dependency never enters the core engine binary. Hosts that need LAN-share playback link it and hand the engine an `smb://` source via the standard `IOReader` seam:

```
Sources/AetherEngineSMB/
├── AetherEngineSMB.swift                    Product entry point: opt-in SMB2/3 byte source, depends on SMBClient (pure-Swift, NWConnection); never linked by the core engine
├── SMBURL.swift                             Parses smb://[user[:password]@]host[:port]/share/path URLs (missing credentials default to guest)
├── SMBConnection.swift                      Read-only SMB byte source over one share + path via SMBClient (persistent connection + FileReader; NTLMv2 / guest, SMB 2.0.2 / 2.1 only)
├── ByteRangeSource.swift                    Random-access read-only byte-source protocol, isolates the network backend from cursor / seek logic for testability
└── SMBIOReader.swift                        Bridges a ByteRangeSource into the engine's IOReader (blocking read via a happens-before semaphore edge)
```

The `aetherctl` CLI target (`Sources/aetherctl/`) is documented separately in [docs/cli.md](cli.md).

### Exact overlap after a live source reconnect

On the single-demuxer stream-copy path, rollback alone is never treated as proof
of replay. A candidate packet must match an accepted packet's source DTS, PTS and
compressed-payload SHA-256 signature. Candidate packets are buffered until both
tracks have passed their previous frontier. A mismatch, read error, EOF or bounded
history/payload limit forwards the pending packets to ordinary discontinuity
handling. Bridged audio and separate side-audio sources are excluded.

The cutter watchdog distinguishes an intentional overlap scan from a stuck cut
while continuing to detect source starvation. No host API or resource policy is
added; the guard and its packet history belong to the producer thread.
